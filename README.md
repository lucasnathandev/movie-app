# Movie App
Link to demo: https://lucasnathandev.github.io/movie-app

### This application can be useful for any website which needs to use an slider to navigate between movies in the UI.
## My code uses:
- Clean code.
- Functiona programming for code organization and less global scope usage.
- "S" from SOLID principles.
